"""
The factorial of a non-negative integer ( n ) is the product of al positive integers less than or
equal to ( n ). It is denoted by ( n! ) and is defined as:
𝑛! = 𝑛 × (𝑛 − 1) × (𝑛 − 2) × … × 3 × 2 × 1
For example:
5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
0!
is defined to be 1.
Factorials are commonly used in mathematics, especialy in combinatorics and probability,
to count the number of ways a set of elements can be arranged or selected.
