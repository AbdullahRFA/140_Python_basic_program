"""
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on an individual's weight and
height. It is commonly used as a screening tool to categorize individuals into different weight
status categories, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity.
The BMI is calculated using the folowing formula:
BMI =
Weight (kg)
Height (m)2
Alternatively, in the imperial system:
Weight (lb)
BMI = Ã— 703
Height (in)2
BMI provides a general indication of body fatness but does not directly measure body fat or
distribution. It is widely used in public health and clinical settings as a quick and simple tool
to assess potential health risks associated with weight. Different BMI ranges are associated
with different health categories, but it's important to note that BMI has limitations and does
not account for factors such as muscle mass or distribution of fat.
